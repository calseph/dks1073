#Scenario:
#A shop offers a discount for customers who spend more than RM100.
#If total purchase is greater than 100, display:
#"You get a discount!"

purchase = float(input("Please input the amount you've spent today: "))
if purchase > 100:
    print("You get a discount!")
else:
    print("Spend more than RM100 now to get a discount!")
